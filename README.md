Sample web application demonstrating some of the key features of Java EE 8 and Spring MVC 3.2.3, including form/bean validations, building RESTful JSON services, and web application initilization using JavaConfig (no Xml at all). There are no static pages for the web application, the focus is on building RESTful JSON services. 

Integrating spring(JMSTemplate) with Java Message Service(JMS) for messaging and working with activeMQ as message broker. 
Used Java Mail API to send email notifications, which are read from the queue asynchronously.
